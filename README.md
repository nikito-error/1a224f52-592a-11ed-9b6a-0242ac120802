## Instruments and tools.

I built it with Spring Tool Suite 4. It is an IDE to develop Spring applications.</br>

I have used Hibernate for easier contact with database.</br>

My database MySQL enables users to meet the database challenges of next generation web, cloud, and communications.</br>

Too added in my application properties file - connection to database with username,password and some hibernate code for update tables and others.</br>

Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool that i used.</br>

## Realization and code

I add json file to my resources and I take data from json file and set it to database.

Make some functions for it and display user data too in my localhost:8080 url;

Use some REST API that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.

Auto generated dependencies in pom xml.

ObjectMapper provides functionality for reading and writing JSON, either to and from basic POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), or to and from a general-purpose JSON Tree Model (JsonNode), as well as related functionality for performing conversions.

JPA for object-relational mappings and for managing persistent objects.
